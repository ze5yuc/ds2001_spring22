#### Work with the Constants.py File

You will work with the cloned [deep learning repo](https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc/)  

Follow these steps:  
- Launch Spyder  
- From the repo, load the the file `/utils/constants.py` into Spyder    
- Reverse sort the list `UNIVARIATE_DATASET_NAMES` (hint: use `.sort(reverse=True)`) and print it  
- Print the dictionary: `dataset_types`
- Print the value associated with the 'Haptics' key in `dataset_types`     
  You might want to refer to our data_types notebook for reference.
